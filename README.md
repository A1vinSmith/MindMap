# MindMap
Some mindmaps

## Mindmap Web Penetration Testing
I've created this mindmap for web penetration testing. I started with this mindmap during the eWPT course and I've updated it with some other techniques.
This is something that should be updated regulary in the near future. The mindmap is created with Freemind and can be found here: https://github.com/mvdvaart/MindMap/blob/main/Web-Penetration-Testing-Mindmap.mm
